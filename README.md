A Javascript function that removes the text from any HTML page

##Why?
Because it's important to access how people look at pages 

##What did you just say?
Most people look at pictures first so this may represent a quick scan of how a new users sees your HTML page

##How?
Just run the function in the console.  If anyone is reading this and actually wants it, I'll build you a link for a bookmarklet. 

##What else?
Sure, please send some feedback/ideas/cupcakes.  I'm hoping to spark some creativity.
